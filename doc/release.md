Several new pipelines were introduced alongside major improvements to
existing functionality.

## Highlights

  - Default `save` parameter is now `'h'`.
  - Use letters `b`, `m`, `h`, `t`, `c`, `g`, and `w` to select outputs.
  - Cortical thickness and CSF/GM/WM probabilities are generated by `t` and
    `c`/`g`/`w` respectively.
  - `'all'` expands to `hcCbm`.
- **Voxel-Based Morphometry and registration**
  - New `reg()` options provide VMnet, SyN/SyNCC and the **FuseMorph** method.
  - A full VBM pipeline can be executed with `tigerbx.reg('v', ...)`.
- **NERVE embedding pipeline** for hippocampus and amygdala patch encoding.
- **GDM distortion correction** applies Generative Displacement Mapping to improve alignment of diffusion and structural images without field maps.
- **Updated default model** `mprage_hlc_v003_resunetplus.onnx`.
- Various bug fixes and improvements throughout the toolbox.
