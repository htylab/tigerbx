### TigerBx: Tissue Mask Generation for Brain Extration

## Background


* This repo provides deep learning methods with pretrained models for brain extraction.
* We also provided the stand-alone application working on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* The software has been exclusively designed for research purposes and is not intended for any commercial application.
* The software should not be used in clinical applications.

### Install stand-alone version
https://github.com/htylab/tigerbx/releases

### Usage

    tigerbx -bmad c:\data\*.nii.gz -o c:\output
    tigerbx -c c:\data\*.nii.gz -o c:\output

### As a python package

    pip install onnxruntime #for gpu version: onnxruntime-gpu
    pip install https://github.com/htylab/tigerbx/archive/release.zip

### As a python package

    import tigerbx
    tigerbx.run('bmadk', r'C:\T1w_dir', r'C:\output_dir')
    tigerbx.run('bmadk', r'C:\T1w_dir\**\*.nii.gz', r'C:\output_dir')
    tigerbx.run('bmadk', r'C:\T1w_dir\**\*.nii.gz') # storing output in the same dir
    tigerbx.run('dg', r'C:\T1w_dir') # Producing deep-gray-matter masks with GPU


** Mac and Windows  are supported.**

** Ubuntu (version >20.04)  are supported.**

** Typically requires about 1 minute to obtain deep gray matter segmenation without GPU**

-b: Producing the extracted brain.
-m: Producing the brain mask.
-a: Producing the aseg mask.
-d: Producing the deep gray matter mask.
-k: Producing the DKT mask.
-c: Producing the cortical thickness map.
-C: Producing the FSL-style PVEs of CSF, GM, WM.
-w: Producing the white matter parcellation.
-W: Producing the white-matter hyperintensity mask (WMH) (WIP).
-q: Save the QC score. Pay attention to QC scores less than 50.
-z: Force storing in nii.gz format.
